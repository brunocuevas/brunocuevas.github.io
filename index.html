				<p>I studied a Bsc in Biotechnology in UPM, then a
				master in Mathematical Modelling at UAB and now I work at
				CBGP as phD student.</p>
				<p>I am currently interested in computational structural
					biology challenges:
				<ul>
					<li>Ligand difussion kinetics</li>
					<li>Enhanced molecular mechanics sampling</li>
					<li>Empiric energy methods</li>
					<li>Electronic density models</li>

						<p>Allergy is nowadays one of the most prevalent diseases
						in western societies, causing a large number of deaths per
						year and large costs to health systems.
						Meanwhile there is a vast knowledge about how to treat  the
						symptoms of the disease, little is known about sensibilization
						causes.
						</p>
						<p>
						Last year, out group reported for the first time the proofs of
						a sensibilization process driven by a ligand transfer process
						between lipid transport proteins and inmune system receptors.
						</p>
						<strong>
							The computational studies on protein-ligand interactions
							allow to understand the process driving sensibilization

							In 1963 Feynman said <q cite="Feynman">Everything
							that living things do can be understood in terms of the
							jiggling and wiggling of atoms</q>. Force field methods
							in structural biology have provided great results by
							considering biologically interesting systems as sets
							of atoms joined by springs.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, many biological process can not be targeted
							using force field methods, and in many cases, the
							underlying simplification of the atomic structure can be
							misleading.
						</p>
						<strong>
							We are working in the construction of a electronic
							density model that can be applied at protein-scale
							systems without incurring in the huge computational
							costs of wave-function calculations.
