# ECBS 2019 - Second day.

The day has been pretty exhausting. Many many talks, from 8:30 to almost 19:00.
I have a strong headache and I am super exhausted (although I will feel guilty
if I don't go to the gym after eating so many butter sandwiches).

I am upset. Nobody has asked me anything about my work; the few
people that I've talked to did not even know that I had a flash yesterday. No
visibility at all. Moreover, today I heard four talks about theory in
chemistry, so if my talk had taken place during the morning it would have
called someone's attention. I think that the organizing committee put me in the
wrong place.

Forgetting about me, there have been many interesting talks about computational
chemistry from people like Modesto Orozco, who is both a great speaker and
makes an awesome work modeling the DNA. I've also enjoyed the talk from
theoretical chemists like Gonzalo Jiménez Osés, who works in the design of new
enzymes, and Carmen Domene, who works in ion channels' regulation.  There was
also a theoretical flash talk from Ferrán Eixas where I heard about accelerated
dynamics. It is another interesting technique in the zoo of *techniques to
avoid the inefficient sampling of molecular dynamics* that I will have to
explore some day.

Afterward, we had the great talk of Gerard JP Van Westen about machine learning
applied to drug discovered. I found out not only his great research in the
development of new tools to explore the chemical space but also the power of
Twitter in these events to contact with people.

And maybe the most amusing talk was the one given by Giuseppe Battaglia (Beppe).
He gave not only a super interesting talk about drug delivery (even with
	mathematical insights), but he also showed a very intelligent sense of humor.
	I laughed quite much with the joke about *drug delivery* and Sicilians.

And there were many other interesting talks. However, it is especially frustrating 
that some people, adult people (consolidated researchers) is unable to give a talk.
And I don't mean that they don't talk for 15 minutes. Yeah, dam they do.
But it's impossible to follow some people, especially if they speak so faint
and uniform.
