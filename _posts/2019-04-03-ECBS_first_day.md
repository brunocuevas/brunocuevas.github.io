# ECBS 2019 - First day.


Today, the [European Chemical Biology Symposium](https://congresosalcala.fgua.es/ecbs2019euchems/) started, and so the first congress where I came as a speaker (flash speaker, to be honest).

I could divide the talks into three groups: those about things that are shiny under the microscope, those about sugars, and those about screened chemicals.
While I have little to say about the two last topics, I really enjoyed the first
talk, from [Stephan Mann](http://www.stephenmann.co.uk/). I enjoyed it so much that I wonder why I am
doing a Ph.D. on my subject when there are so amazing subjects out there. His talk was mainly focused on the development of *artificial ways of life*,
in the form of *proteisomes* that can develop complex behaviors like
movement (chaotic indeed!!!), beating and depredation.

Can a theoretical folk like me do anything on that topic?

It's also worth mentioning the talk from Margit Jeschke (Novartis) about the new challenges that the new Novartis treatment against cancer, based in the *re-training* of immune cells of the patient has. It is very interesting to understand the limitations of these new therapies and the new issues that they are associated with. For instance, a good example is the topic of quality. If you know that one batch of your treatment is not good enough, but your patient requires it to survive as soon as possible, is it ethical to administer it?

Regarding my talk, I think it was short and painless. I don't really remember
being there, because everything happened pretty fast. This is not only the
first time I talk but the first time I present something related to my thesis.
It is true that most of what I presented is still tentative (I may even take
some weeks after this to make a few steps back). But I think is still innovative at some point.

I have not received much feedback. I think that it may happen that most people are not working in the field of theoretical chemistry so it may have been irrelevant. But maybe tomorrow someone asks me something.
