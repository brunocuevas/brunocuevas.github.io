# Exploring Pru P 3 energy landscapes: My first main-author article

When I started this blog I thought I would be able to save half an hour every
week to write something. And I even thought that I could develop and explain 
my own toy-algorithms. But at the end, time is never enough.

Today I am writting to announce my [first article](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/6/1432) 
as main author. It is the fruit of hard work in a secondary project (my thesis is 
NOT about ligand diffusion), where my first aim was to explain ligand diffusion 
of the ligand. In the article, we show the theoretical estimates of binding 
energy of the natural ligand of Pru p 3, the major allergen from peach. 
We also make our first contact with a brand new methodology, the exploration 
of the free energy landscape using metadynamics. Thanks to this tecnique we 
could observe which paths for diffusion of the ligand are qualitatively more 
likely, based on the energy of the bassins near equilibrium.


Of course, there is much work to do left, and there are many aspects of 
metadynamics and enhanced sampling in general that I still need to learn. Our
next step will surely be the simulation of ligand diffusion in a membrane model.
However, I dont' think we'll start it until we see a real improvement in our
calculation capacity. 

From a personal/proffesional perspective, I have learnt two important things:
- Small secondary projects tend to become the main project if you place no control over time
- It is always better not to touch the default parameters until you are an expert in the field

NOTE: I really think we have to be more open about how we do things, even
if it can turn against us. Therefore, I've uploaded a repository in Github
to provide most of the input information to reproduce my simulations.
