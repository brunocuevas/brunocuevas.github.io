# ECBS 2019 - Third and last day. Some comments

Today the symposium was finished. It has been very satisfying and I have seen
many exciting topics, especially, everything related to nanoparticles.

It is curious to check that, in the end, everybody works in clustered topics.
Of course, most of the people here are in the first row of science, publishing
in Nature, Science, and other high impact journals, so nobody could say that
they are not into very promising topics. But all talks and posters had
relatives, which means that either there are a few interesting areas with a lot
of place for different approaches, or that there is a tendency to work in the
same topics or trends.

My favorite speaker today was  Thomas R. Ward, not only because his topic was
an attractive one (artificial metalloenzymes) but also because he gave a very
elegant talk. No jokes, no silly stuff, but still entertaining.

I've also heard that the talk from Rolf Müller was a great one, tacking one
of the most dangerous threats to society nowadays (antibiotic resistance).
However, my boss and me we missed this talk to attend the one from Yousseff
Bekhadir in our research center (CBGP), that was about their platform to detect
high-throughput interactions between receptor proteins upon ligand binding.

So, as you can see, I had a busy day and a busy week. I hope I can chill a
little bit this weekend.

congratulations to Carmen for her best-flash-talk award)
