# Why we need vocational scholarships for post-docs

First of all, **I am writing from my perspective as a Ph.D. candidate in Spain**.
I hope science works better in other places.

Today I was asked what I am going to do after obtaining my Ph.D. And it's a good
question. And a recurrent question. When you work in academia, you have to
wonder about what are you going to do next every 4-5 years. Or even more often.
You study for a bachelor degree. Then a master. Then you find a Ph.D. scholarship. Then
you apply for a post-doc scholarship. Afterward, finding a second post-doc
scholarship. And so on until you can ask for a vacancy at university or at a
research center. And then, every three years, ask for the national project to
get funding for the people working for you. And one day, you may retire.


And I have to say. It produces a little anxiety effect upon me. So many
deadlines. But I guess that all works have their own shortcomings.


Coming back to the question I was asked, I answered that I may go start playing
Spanish folk-music (*Rumba*, to be more precise). Of course, this is a joke. I
was born scientist, and I *have to be a scientist until the day I die*. Young and
old scientists we feel trap of our own character. The scientists. You must
always have some hypothesis, you must enjoy seminars, you have to read scientific
papers in your free time, and you have to rule your field.


I think that we start believing in our own legend too soon. Before scientists,
we are people. We feel the fatigue, we get sleepy when reading an article after
having lunch, and we do not always feel interested in explaining the world.
**But this is not bad!** Police officers, doctors, teachers, consultants, ...
all those people do not enjoy every minute of their work time. However, it is
pretty common among scientists to find a certain feeling of guilt when you are
into things beyond science. Of course, I do not mean that my colleagues are
living miserably. But we find many times that to be as good as the system
expects us to be, we should be expending more time working, renounce to our
leisure.


Sometimes, I think about all the other things I could be doing apart from
science. I do not mean that I feel sorry about choosing a scientific career.
But I believe that I am a versatile person (I started in biology and now I am
working with some quantum stuff, so I think that at least I have proved
some conceptual flexibility), and sometimes I consider that if I had the chance
to try other tasks, I could also be good at. Because there is one generally
accepted fact: people in science are intelligent (forgive if it looks snobby.
I do not mean that I am more intelligent than anyone). And I guess that
intelligence comes with the capacity of adaptation.


My point in this post is to convince some eccentric billionaire (since it
does not look that the administration would listen to this strange idea) to
create a scholarship to make scientists distance from science for a period
of about two years (I believe that the right term is *leave*, but I am not sure),
and then:

- Learn to play the banjo
- Master capoeira
- Write a novel
- Win a cooking contest
- Go living to Japan
- Start your own band
- Become a kung-fu legend
- ...

And so on.

Okay, I know it. It sounds stupid, especially when we have way more urgent
problems to solve. But I can argue that:

    My point in this post is to convince some eccentric billionaire

What I defend with this sort of crazy idea is that scientists should have some
way to stop doing science for a while, relax and do something that is not their
thing. Nowadays, we hear about automation. And I am sure that working hours
will be reduced by the end of this new decade. But I see that it is little
possibility that the reduction reaches scientists, dut to the (self)imposed
standards that we aim to fulfill. Therefore, some help that allows scientists to
stop and find other tasks may be a way to stop the wheel (GoT fan, by the way).

But is not only about some reward for the people doing the innovation that
allows everybody to live in modern society. It is also about productivity. The
the same way that tight schedules give place to stressed workers that will go on
leave more often due to mental illness, I believe that scientists imagination
and inspiration is many times capped by the stressful agenda of research. Giving
scientists the chance to go on with their own personal goals could return in the
form of more motivated workers that can target new problems or offer new
solutions. An interesting case, as long as I remember when he gave a seminar,
is [Sir Thomas Blundell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Blundell), who
went to Japan and started a rock band before becoming one of the most
successful structural biologists ever.

And the third reason why I consider that some idiosyncratic millionaire with more
money than common sense should fund my leave to learn playing guitar is that
scientists we may have a lot of talent. I do not mean that because you are good
at physics it means you have to be good at Judo. But I hold that we should
give some chance to show that before scientists, we are people.
