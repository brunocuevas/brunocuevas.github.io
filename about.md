## Biography

- I was Born in Madrid in the 90s.
- I was never good at soccer, and I never had a gameboy. Therefore, had a lonely
primary school
- Honors in high school
- In 2012 I started [Biotechnology](http://www.upm.es/Estudiantes/Estudios_Titulaciones/EstudiosOficialesGrado/ArticulosRelacionados?fmt=detail&id=fd8c88ff1da0f210VgnVCM10000009c7648a____)
as UPM
- The same year I found out how little I being the representative of my classmates
- In 2015 I started the computational branch. Never could have chosen better.
- In 2016 I presented my bachelor thesis under direction of Fernando Garc√≠a-Arenal. It was about
epidemiological models in plant-virus pathosystems. We may publish it some day. Some day.
- That summer I was accepted to go to EPFL. But since I don't know the recipe
to become millionaire in just one summer, I could not go.
- Then I chose to study a master in Mathematical Modelling For Science and Engineering in
Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.
- Although I was the only biologist there, I managed to survive.
- I made my master thesis under direction of Juan Fernandez Recio in BSC about
methods to predict the impact on protein-protein binding affinity upon
mutation. We may publish it. Some day. Some day.
- Luis F. Pacios was persistent enough in the idea of studying a PhD under
his direction in things that at that time I did not understand really well that
now I am a PhD student at CBGP, in the [group of Araceli Diaz Perales](alislab.es)
- I am spending 50% of my time developping a new method to model electron
density in macromolecules (which will be my thesis), a 30% working in
structural computational biology problems related with allergy, and a 20%
drinking coffee.

## Academic Interests

- Computer stuff. Especially programming.
- Molecular modelling, especially enhanced sampling methods.
- Quantum mechanics calculations.
- Sometimes I enjoy reading about complex systems, which is my master specialization.

## Skills

- English (C1, CAE) and French (B2, DELF)
- Fluent in Python (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, prody, ...). Begginer in
C, I still find difficulties to know whether this variable is a pointer of a
pointer of a pointer
- I am learning to setup webpages [like this one](alislab.es)
- I once worked in a lab...

## Hobbies

Ok, I am not only a walking CV. I like:
- spending time making things like this blog
- working out
- learning to dance lindy hop
- reading sci-fi
- watching some TV series

My favourite band, so you know, is The Cat Empire, my favourite TV series is
Rick And Morty and my favourite writter is Jose Saramago.
