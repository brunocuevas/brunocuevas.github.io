# Bruno Cuevas

- I was born in the 90's in some neighborhood at southern Madrid
- When 5, I wanted to be a policeman. Soon I change my mind. Again and again. But
it did not take long until I decided I'd be a scientist.
- Deeply religious until he got a bicycle for his catholic communion. From then,
he denied up and down all religions.
- At the age of 15 I read a book about
[genome stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_(book) and I thought
**wow, this rocks**.
- After studying hard, I got accepted in Biotechnology in UPM as soon as I
finished high-school.
- I was attracted to structural biology from the beggining of the degree. Then
my interest moved from systems biology to bioinformatics until last course.
- I made my bachelor thesis under direct supervision of F. Garc√≠a-Arenal, in
epidemiological models of plant-viruses. I got a prize for the "best final
degree thesis in Biotechnology".
- I decided to move on the direction on modelling, so I went to UAB to study a
master in Mathematical Modelling. Crazy stuff, but against all odds, I passed all
subjects.
- My master thesis took place under supervision of J. Fernandez-Recio, at BSC.
The topic was the prediction of the effect of mutations upon protein-protein
binding.
- During this time, L. Fernandez Pacios convinces him to apply for some
grants so I could come back to Madrid.
- In January 2018 I got my scolarship from UPM program. And here I am, working
half time in my thesis (mathematical models of electronic density) and the other
half working in applied computational biology problems.
- I love jogging, lindy-hop dancing, wheat beer, "callos" and nasty stuff alike,
Rick and Morty and The Cat Empire.
