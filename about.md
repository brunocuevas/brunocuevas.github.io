## Biography

- I was Born in Madrid in the 90s.
- Honors in high school
- In 2012 I started [Biotechnology](http://www.upm.es/Estudiantes/Estudios_Titulaciones/EstudiosOficialesGrado/ArticulosRelacionados?fmt=detail&id=fd8c88ff1da0f210VgnVCM10000009c7648a____)
as UPM
- In 2015 I started the computational branch
- In 2016 I presented my bachelor thesis under direction of Fernando Garc√≠a-Arenal, about epidemiological models in plant-virus pathosystems
- After finishing my BSc, I decided to study a master in Mathematical Modelling For Science and Engineering in
Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. It is worth remarking that I was the only student without a physical/mathematical background. But I managed to survive there.
- I made my master thesis under direction of Juan Fernandez Recio in BSC about methods to predict the impact on protein-protein binding affinity upon mutation.
- In 2018 I moved back to Madrid to start a PhD under the direction of my former structural biology proffessor, Luis F. Pacios. The topic was the description of theoretical electron density on proteins.
- In 2019, I moved to Upsala Universitet to have a research internship al Lynn Kamerlin lab, working on GTPase enzymatic mechanisms.
- I expect to finish the PhD in July 2021.

## Academic Interests

- Computer stuff.
- Molecular modelling, especially enhanced sampling methods.
- Quantum mechanics calculations.
- Sometimes I enjoy reading about complex systems, which is my master specialization.

## Skills

- English (C1, CAE) and French (B2, DELF)
- Python. I have a special relationship with the deep learning library PyTorch.
- I am learning to setup webpages [like this one](alislab.es)
- I once worked in a lab...

## Hobbies

Ok, I am not only a walking CV. I like:
- spending time making things like this blog
- jogging
- dancing lindy hop (this is an example of pre-covid hobby)
- reading sci-fi
